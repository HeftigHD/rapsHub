## Using the hub
To use the hub, simply run this! Only works on Synapse.
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeftigHD/rapsHub/main/RaptorsHubSeasonStart.txt"))()
```

## Acknowledgements 
This Hub wouldn't have been possible without the continued support of the following:

 - Secret Service Director Zinnia
 - Secret Service Governing Council
 - Several imperial scientists from the Secret Service
 - The Raptors

## UI Lib
For the first time, we are releasing the UI Lib that our hub uses!
There are three UI Libs:

 - Raptors Hub UI Lib V1, which is used by this hub
 https://github.com/HeftigHD/unknown
 - Raptors Hub UI Lib V2, an improved version of the UI Lib that isn't currently used by the Hub
 https://github.com/HeftigHD/uiLibTwo
  - Raptors Hub UI Lib - Square Edition, an alternative version of the UI Lib. Different style!
